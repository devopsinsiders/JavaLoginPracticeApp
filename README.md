- **Maven**: Apache Maven is used for building the project. Download and install Maven from [Maven's official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- **Apache Tomcat**: A web server and servlet container for deploying the WAR file. Download it from [Apache Tomcat's website](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi).

     cp target/JavaLoginShowcase.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/
     ```
   - Restart the Tomcat server to deploy the WAR file:
     ```bash
     $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
     $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
